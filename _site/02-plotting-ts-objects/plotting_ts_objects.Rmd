Currently, the main method for visualize `tsibble` objects is with the `autoplot` function from [fabletools](https://fabletools.tidyverts.org/) / [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) packages to create auto-plots of `tsibble` objects.

Let's load and transform the natural gas consumption in the US into tsibble object and plot it:

```{r }
library(tsibble)
library(fabletools)
library(dplyr)

naturalgas_path <- paste(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(), "data", "NATURALGAS.csv", sep = "/")

us_gas <- read.csv(naturalgas_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(c("date", "y")) %>%
  mutate(date = yearmonth(as.Date(date))) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = "date")

us_gas %>% autoplot(.vars = y) 
```


As the `autoplot` function exported from the **ggplot2** package, we can customize the plot and add additional layers using any of the **ggplot2**  package functionality: 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

us_gas %>% autoplot(.vars = y) + 
  xlab("Source: U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Natural Gas Consumption [NATURALGAS]") + 
  ylab("Billion Cubic Feet") + 
  ggtitle("US Natural Gas Consumption (Not Seasonally Adjusted)")
```

Last but not least, we can convert the plot into a plotly object using the `ggplotly` function from the [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) package: 

```{r}
library(plotly)

p <- us_gas %>% autoplot(.vars = y) + 
  xlab("Source: U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Natural Gas Consumption [NATURALGAS]") + 
  ylab("Billion Cubic Feet") + 
  ggtitle("US Natural Gas Consumption (Not Seasonally Adjusted)")


ggplotly(p)
```


### Plotting multiple time series objects

The `autoplot` function automatically idenify the `tsibble` object `key`, if exists, and plot the series accordignlly. In the following example we will plot all trips to Sydney by trip type using the `tourism` dataset. Let's first subset the the dataset to all trips to region Sydney:

```{r}
data("tourism")

sydney <- tourism %>% filter(Region == "Sydney")

head(sydney)

key_data(sydney)
```

As you can see from the output of the `key_data`, there are 4 unique series in the Sydney trips subset. We will now plot those series with the `autoplot` and `ggplot` funtions:

```{r}
p <- sydney %>% autoplot()

ggplotly(p) %>%
  layout(title = "Sydney Domestic Overnight Trups by Purpose",
         yaxis = list(title = "Overnight Trips in Thousands"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: tsibble package"))
```


### Interactive visualization with Plotly

While the `ggplotly` function enables us to transform a static **ggplot2** plot into an interactive **plotly** object, it is harder to apply the `layout` functionality. An alternative approach would be to plot the object directly with the **plotly** package. Let's replot the consumption of natural gas in the US: 

```{r}
us_gas %>%
 plot_ly(x = ~ date,
         y = ~ y,
          type = "scatter",
          mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "US Natural Gas Consumption (Not Seasonally Adjusted)",
         yaxis = list(title = "Billion Cubic Feet"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Natural Gas Consumption [NATURALGAS]"))
```

One thing to notice - the attribute of the object `index`, the `yearmon` class, is lost. One way to fix it is to convert the object `index` to a `Date` object:

```{r}
us_gas %>%
 plot_ly(x = ~ as.Date(date),
          y = ~ y,
          type = "scatter",
          mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "US Natural Gas Consumption (Not Seasonally Adjusted)",
         yaxis = list(title = "Billion Cubic Feet"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Natural Gas Consumption [NATURALGAS]",
                      type = "date",
                      tickformat = "%b %Y"))
```

Similarly, we can plot the `sydney` series we created earlier by creating a unique id by the different series `key` columns, subset, and plot with the `add_lines` function:

```{r}
sydney$id <- do.call(paste, c(sydney[,key_vars(sydney)], sep = "|"))

head(sydney)

p <- plot_ly()

for(i in unique(sydney$id)){
  
  df <- sydney %>% filter(id == i) 
  
  p <- p %>%
    add_lines(x = as.Date(df$Quarter),
              y = df$Trips,
              type = "scatter",
              mode = "lines",
              name = i)
}

p %>% layout(legend = list(orientation = "h"))

```

#### Exercise 1

```{r}
us_abs_path <- paste(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(), "data", "Alcoholic Beverages Sales.csv", sep = "/")

us_abs <- read.csv(us_abs_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(c("date", "y")) %>%
  mutate(index = yearmonth(as.Date(date))) %>%
  select(-date) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = index)
```

#### Exercise 2

```{r}
ca_elec_path <- paste(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(), "data", "ca_elec.rda", sep = "/")

load(ca_elec_path)

ca_elec_ts <- ca_elec %>%
  as_tsibble(index = date_time, key = operator)
```
