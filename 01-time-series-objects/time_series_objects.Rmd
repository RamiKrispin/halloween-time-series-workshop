Time series data describes a sequence of observations that were captured over time. Each data point of the series is associated with a unique timestamp. Typically, the term time series (or series) refers to regular time series data, where:

* **Irregular time series -** any time-series data that its observations are not equally spaced in time
* **Regular time series -** defines as a sequence of observations that are equally spaced over time (e.g., a constant time interval). Examples of common regular time series data: 
    * Quarterly GDP 
    * Monthly unemployment
    * Daily water consumption 
    * Hourly temperatures
    * Half hour demand for electricity 

In this workshop, we will focus only on **regular** time series data.

R provides a variety of time series classes and objects. The most common classes are:

* `ts` - R built-in class for time-series objects.It is part of the **stats** package time series analysis and forecasting eco-system. The structure of this class is vector and matrix for `mts` objects (multiple time series)
`xts`/`zoo` - flexible format for handling both regular and irregular time series data in a table format. Mainly used for finance applications
 `tsibble` - a tidy data format for time series data, fairly similar to the xts/zoo packages
 
In this workshop, we will focus on the `tsibble` class.

### The ts class

```{r}


data("AirPassengers")

class(AirPassengers)

AirPassengers
```

```{r}
start(AirPassengers)

end(AirPassengers)

time(AirPassengers)

deltat(AirPassengers)

frequency(AirPassengers)

cycle(AirPassengers)
```

### The tsibble class

The **tsibble** package provides a tidy data structure and tools for handling regular and irregular time series data. The `tsibble` class enables to store single and multiple time series objects in a `data.frame` / `tbl` format with time  awareness attributes.

#### The tsibble attributes

The `tsibble` class has a table structure with time awareness. Its main attributes are:

* As the `tsibble` class is based on `tbl` / `data.frame` classes, it inherits their attributes and functionalities. Hence, `dplyr` or other utility tools that can be used with `tbl` and `data.frame` objects can be used with `tsibble` objects

* `index` - a `tsibble` object has an `index` column that defines the timestamp or intervals of the series. The `index` could have the following date/time classes:

| **Interval** | **Class**                 |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Annual       | `integer`/`double`        |
| Quarterly    | `yearquarter`             |
| Monthly      | `yearmonth`               |
| Weekly       | `yearweek`                |
| Daily        | `Date`/`difftime`         |
| Subdaily     | `POSIXt`/`difftime`/`hms` |


**Table source:** the **tsibble** package [README](https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble/blob/master/README.md) file

* A `tsibble` object can represent a multiple time series object in a wide or long format:

  * **Wide-format -**  each column represents a series, and every row share the same index
  * **Long-format -** with the use of key column/s

* `key` - optional, enables to represent multiple time series in a long format, by using single or multiple columns as series key/s


#### Creating a tsibble object

The `as_tsibble` function enables to convert data.frame or ts objects into a tsibble object. In the following example, we will load the [Natural Gas Consumption](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NATURALGAS) series. This series represents the monthly consumption of natural gas in the US since January 2000:

```{r}
library(tsibble)
library(dplyr)

naturalgas_path <- paste(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(), "data", "NATURALGAS.csv", sep = "/")

us_gas <- read.csv(naturalgas_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(c("date", "y")) 

head(us_gas)

str(us_gas)

```

This series has two columns:

* `date` - the timestamp of the observations
* `y` - the series values

We will reformat the `date` column from `character` into `Date` and use this column as the series `index`:

```{r}
us_gas$date <- as.Date(us_gas$date) %>% yearmonth()

us_gas_tsibble <- us_gas %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = "date")

class(us_gas_tsibble)

head(us_gas_tsibble)
```
As you can see, the `tsibble` class has `tbl` alike `print` method, with additional information about the series intervals, which is monthly. Let's explore the new object attributes:

```{r}
interval(us_gas_tsibble)

index(us_gas_tsibble)

key(us_gas_tsibble)
```

Since we did not define a `key`, the object does not have a key.


#### Converting a ts object into a tsibble

The `as_tsibble` function enables to convet `ts` object to `tsibble`. We will use the function to convert the `AirPassegers` from a `ts` object to a `tsibble` object:

```{r }
ap_tsibble <- AirPassengers %>% as_tsibble()

class(ap_tsibble)

head(ap_tsibble)

interval(ap_tsibble)
```

The function convert the ts object time vector into an index object. 

Note: as the time vector of the `ts` object can represent only two components of the timestamp (e.g., year and month, year and day, etc.), the transformation of the vector into a three or four components timestamp index (such as `Date` or other classes) might be ambiguous in some cases. 


#### Multiple time series object

The `tourism` dataset, from the **tsibble** package, is an example of multiple time series object in a long format. This series descibe the number of overnight trips per quarter across Australia by region, state and purpose: 

```{r}
library(tsibble)

data("tourism")

class(tourism)

head(tourism)
```

Where in this case, the `Quarter` column defines the series `index` and the `Region`, `State`, and `Purpose` columns defines the series `key`:

```{r}
index(tourism)

key(tourism)

key_vars(tourism)

key_data(tourism) %>% head()
```

This one of the cases the interaction between **dplyr** and **tsibble** is super useful:

```{r}
sydney <- tourism %>% filter(State == "New South Wales",
                             Region == "Sydney",
                             Purpose == "Holiday")

head(sydney)

key_data(sydney)
```



### Exercises

Let's practice what we learned so far:

* Load the Alcoholic Beverages Sales dataset from CSV file (`data` folder), reformat the timesampt to `yearmonth` and convert to `tsibble` object with the `as_tsibble` function

```{r}
us_abs_path <- paste(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(), "data", "Alcoholic Beverages Sales.csv", sep = "/")

us_abs <- read.csv(naturalgas_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(c("date", "y")) 

head(us_abs)
```



* Load the California electricity production by provider dataset - `ca_elec.rda` file (also in `data` folder) and convert the `data.frame` object to `tsibble` object, where the `key` of the series should be the `operator` column

```{r}
ca_elec_path <- paste(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(), "data", "ca_elec.rda", sep = "/")

load(ca_elec_path)

head(ca_elec)
```
